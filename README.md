You can find the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems/home/welcome).

## About the Course

This course has provided me with valuable insights into the world of embedded systems, allowing me to revisit and reinforce the knowledge I acquired during my academic years.

### Week 1: Getting Started
In the first week, we delved into the fundamentals of embedded systems. We wrote C programs to perform statistical analysis, learning how to compile code and lay the foundation for the course.
