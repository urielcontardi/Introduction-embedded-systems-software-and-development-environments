# [Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems)

The point of this code is to be a refresher on the C language.  It has an array of data and will perform various statistical analysis on the data array.
    * Min
    * Max
    * Median
    * Mean (avg)

## Description

In this programming assignment you will create a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset. This assignment will help you get re-oriented with c-programming syntax and host machine compilation. We begin by setting up a version control repository on your local machine. You will then develop and test your code there. When complete, you will upload a zip of your repository to Coursera. Please read through all instructions before starting.

## Usage

To just compile the code using gcc, issue the following command:
```bash
gcc -o stats.out stats.c
./stats.out
```
